# Bank Marketing Customer Purchase Prediction

üîç **Objective:**
To predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## Steps Taken:

### Data Loading and Preprocessing:
- Loaded the Bank Marketing dataset and handled missing values.
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding to prepare the data for modeling.

### Data Splitting:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### Model Training:
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier using the scikit-learn library.
- Utilized training data to build the model.

### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluated the model's performance on the test data.
- Achieved an impressive accuracy score, showcasing the model's predictive power.
- Generated a classification report and confusion matrix to analyze the results comprehensively.

### Visualization:
- Visualized the decision tree to understand the decision-making process of the model.
- Created visualizations to display the distribution of passenger class and survival rates using seaborn and matplotlib.

## Results:

- The model provided valuable insights into customer behavior, helping to identify key factors influencing purchasing decisions.
- These insights can significantly aid in targeted marketing strategies and customer relationship management.

## Key Visualizations:

### Decision Tree Visualization:
- A visual representation of the decision tree to understand the model's decision-making process.

### Passenger Class Distribution:
- A bar chart showing the distribution of different passenger classes.

### Survival Rates by Passenger Class:
- A bar chart displaying the survival rates categorized by passenger class.
